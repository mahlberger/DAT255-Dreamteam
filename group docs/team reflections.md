Team Reflection week 1, Thursday 22/3

The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value
Now
Due to limited information about the project and its scope, it is impossible to tell at this stage.
Goal
The goal is to gain enough knowledge about the project and expectations of the project owner to be able to define the chosen scope of the application.
Gap
Through lectures, literature and conversations with the product owner we will get further insight into the project and what features should be prioritized in the application. 
Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week
Now
During the first week a first draft of a social contract was created containing specifications such as; members and email addresses, meeting schedule, rules on attendance, responsibilities and roles, time log policy, documentation policy and ambition levels.
Goal
Since we are currently lacking information regarding the project, we were unable to complete the social contract. Next week we will therefore add new roles and responsibilities and more detailed description of scrum rules and sprint techniques. 
Gap
To be able to fill this weeks information gap we need to attend lectures on scrum techniques and discuss our take on it. We will also review the course literature to see if we can find more information on working with scrum. By attending the project introduction lecture (next week) we will hopefully get a fuller picture of the project scope and will then be able to adjust the social contract correctly.

The following points we are not yet able to define since the information hasn’t been reviewed this early in the course. Our goal is to fill in the gaps by attending lectures and gaining knowledge from course literature and information from the project owner:
The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application
Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom
The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)
The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)
The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)
Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation
The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress
Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself

The roles you have used within the team
Now
In our first week we have assigned some roles to our team members including Scrum master, secretary for meetings, a casting vote, a chief location officer (CLO). 
Goal
To have a relevant task assigned for every member, but still an equal amount of work.
Gap
To reach our goal we will have to learn about which relevant tasks that exists in a project of this format and have responsibilities that require somewhat equal efforts for a fair workload. 


The agile practices you have used for the current sprint
Now
In the first week our team had initially limited experiences of agile practices, both about what it is and how it should be adopted in an IT project. 
Goal
To get acquainted with and use Scrum during the project. 
Gap
We will learn the agile practices by going to the lectures as well as reading literatures about useful practices that we can try and evaluate. 


The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)
Now
We have created a table where we keep records of the time spent on this course.   
Gap
Hard to reach 20h/week in the first week since we haven’t been introduced to the application. This week we have spent the time on lectures and learning git/scrum practices, around 12 hours in total as a group as of thursday, first week. 
Goal
Reach 20h/week for every member which will be audited every week.
The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)
In this section we’re considering this weeks LEGO exercise
Now
We tried to asses out team velocity and the scope of the user stories.
Goal
Our goal is to become better at assessing velocity and scope of the user stories.
Gap
Live activity based training (aka learning by doing).


Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)
Now
We have started using GitHub, Git as well as Trello.
Goal
Learn how to use the tools efficiently and according to best practices.
Gap
Initially learning by doing. Further down the road we will consult online guides and other available resources.
Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)
We have not yet had any guest lectures or read any course literature.
