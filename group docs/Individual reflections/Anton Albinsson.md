## Week 1 ## 

**what do I want to learn or understand better?**
In the first week I have very limited understanding on which different methods/frameworks are suitable in an agile project.
In the lectures I have heard about Scrum but I am not sure exactly how this concrete will be implemented.
My goal is to learn about Scrum by learning about some concrete examples of what different elements such as a product backlog or user story might look like. 
I want to reach my goal by experimenting with a Trello to customize a board this sprint and add cards that represent items in a real agile project. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
I believe that because we as a team have limited experience with using tools such as Trellos one goal could be to help with how Trello can be implemented in our agile project.
To do this it will require me to learn more about the Trello tool and create test boards where we can try different approaches to find out what works best for all of us.  

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
In this first week my knowledge about scrum is very limited and therefore it's hard to contribute to the team's application of scrum.
I want to help the team's application of scrum by fixing a Trello so we easier view our product and sprint backlogs. 
To do this I can search the web for current best practices of combining Trello with Scrum and adapt to our current project format. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**
For this first week it's hard to determine exactly our team's deliveries.
I believe this goal will be more to find out about which deliveries our team will and should have.
To get there I will be part of our group meetings and lectures. 


## Week 2 ## 
 
**what do I want to learn or understand better?**
After the last sprint lectures about scrum and discussions in our group meetings I feel I have a better view of Scrum, for example I have learned the difference between the retrospectrive vs review, even if its ofcourse a lot more to learn.  We have also discussed the implementation of Scrum in our group meetings and I have created a first draft of what it can look like. 

This sprints goal is to learn more about the PortableCDM. I want to better understand how the code architecture iTs as well as how APIs work as I feel it's important to know to avoid double-work in future sprints.  

To reach this goal I will look at the current code of PortableCDM to understand how it works. I believe our group meeting is a good way to discuss things like what its limitations is so we know where we should direct our foucs. For API I will do soem resarch online to get a better picture of it. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
As we have created our first Trello Board and talked about different approaches to adapt scrum in Trello I believe we as a group have learned more about Trellos possibilities and also limitations in applying scrum. 

This sprint I want to help our team by reading the scenario and be involved in group mettings to take a active role in sketching the workflow of the pilot organization so we can learn about which aspects is important of the pilot organization. This will help use create better user stories that are focused on the pilot organizations view. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
I believe that the Trello Board created have helped us be better prepared to implement scrum in our workflow process.

As I showed the team there are several apporaches to set Trello + Scrum. This sprints goal will be to test one of the approaches and see if it works or if we should try another one. This will be done by being active in our group meeting, especially in our retrospective. 


**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**
As we have met the product owners and had group meetings I believe we have a better picture of our deliveries.

This sprint goal will be to further break down this deliveries by setting up user stories. I want to contribute by reading more about the scenario and be active in group meetings to find the workflow of the pilot organization. 

## Week 3 ##

**what do I want to learn or understand better?**
In retrospective I realized that setting up the developer enviroment was much harder than anticipated. As I still have not made the developer enviroment work (Android Studio), I still feel that I lack understanding of how the code architecture works. 

This sprints goal will therefore be revised to first setting up the developer enviroment correctly, e.g. can run the app without problems in android studio. Depending if I am achiving this, another goal will be to edit some of the exisiting code, as I believe this is a good way to learn more about how the code architecture works.

To achieve my goal I will discuss my problems with our group, I will search the web for forums were similar issues have been posted and I will also post my problems in the DAT255 slack channel. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
In our group meetings we was able from the sketch of the workflow create a bulletin list over the pilot organizations workflow, which gave us a better overview of the pilot organizations role. 

This sprint I believe that we all will have to learn more about react-native in order to be able to code in the future sprints. As such, I want to educate myself about this framework by watching tutorials on youtube, and then hopefully be able to help someone by sharing this information I have learned. 


**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
Besides taking part of our group meeting and attending the lectures, as my role as Trello responsible I had helped my team by adjusting our Trello Board to help our agile practices. For example, one of our KPI's is focused around comparing our velocity vs actual time of user stories completed. As such I have recommended the extension Scrum for Trello which helps easier input time spent on each user stories. In our group meeting we also came to the conclusion that we should try the approach of 1 board for each sprint. 

This sprint goal will be to establish some rules for how we are allowed to move user stories in our board. For example, when and whom can move a user story from the testing to done coloumn. Having a set of rules will make it easier for us to make fair comparissons on our actual achivments, which is important if we want to create a better process in our group. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**
This sprint we as a group has had group meetings where we discussed the scenario and drafted user stories. Our group also met with the pilot organization which helped us with some prioritizations of our user stories. 

The goal of this sprint is to alter our user stories to better fit the product owners needs and take input to be able to put priority levels on our user stories. I also want to be part of splitting up a user story into tasks so we are enabling us to start coding which will help our deliveries by showing something concrete to our proudct owner next sprint. 

## Week 4 ##

**what do I want to learn or understand better?**
In retrospective I have achived my goal of setting up the developer enivroment but have very little experience with the coding part. 

This sprints goal will be to learn more about coding in Javascript with React Native framework as well as how to work effectivly in a pair when programming. 

To achieve my goal I will, together with my colleague in pair programming, try to code one of our user stories. I believe I will learn alot about js/react for just doing some practical work involving code but also be active with my colleague and ask this person for any tips regarding js/react. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
After watching several tutorials on youtube last sprint I gained somewhat knowledge about js/react even though I feel the need for coding in order to get a better understanding so I did not reach last sprints goal exactly.

This sprint I believe my goal will still be to help someone learn more about react-native/javascript but this week it will be focused around my colleague whom I will be doing the pair programming with. I want to reach this goal by summarizing my findings from the youtube tutorial as well as reading on the web about similar components that we can take inspiration from. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
How to make an effective flow of our user stories in our board is still a hard question. Some of the suggestions for solving this flow is to 1) break down a card holding a user story involving several tasks to multiple card containg one card each and 2) setting up a clear definition of done & acceptance critiera. Since we can't plan for everything in advanced, one way of application scrum is here to test one week and then in our retrospective see how our process was affected. 

This sprints goal will be to make a clear and meaningful seperation in our Trello Board between Epics, User Stories and Tasks. Achiving this will require to take use of different elements in trello such as multiple lists and labels, but also to listen closely to the group members for what they find most practical to use as nothing is value-adding of its own. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**
I have attended group meetings in this sprint where we have created user stories and made some intitial prioritizations. 

Goals of this sprint will be to take one of the user stories in our sprint backlog, and together with my colleague, implement this in code to help our deliveries. To do this we will have to break down our user stories into tasks and then start working on coding.
